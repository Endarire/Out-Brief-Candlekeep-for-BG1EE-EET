# Out Brief Candlekeep for BG1EE & EET
Temnix's Out, Brief Candlekeep! mod for BG1EE &amp; EET.  The latest version has Olvyn's Class Spell tool applied for its single spell, Vanishing Act (Arcane 1, Illusion).  For technical reasons, only Bards & Wizards can learn Vanishing Act and only from a scroll of it.
